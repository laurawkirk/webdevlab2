In this lab I built a simple responsive website sharing some of my favorite spots on the UW campus. A navigation bar leads you to learn more about each location. I utilized HTML, CSS, and Java Script to write the code for this website. Some highlights were adding a toggle to the See Also in the navigation bar, a summary table in the refrence section, and a toggle section holding my information about what to do in the QUAD based on the season. Overall I really enjoyed working on this lab.
